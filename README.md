# First step into GraphQL. 

This project is instructed at [this tutorial](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/build-an-apollo-graphql-server-with-typescript-and-webpack-hot-module-replacement-hmr-3c339d05184f)

I tried many articles before but with a fresher in TypeScript and GraphQL like me, all of them are not for me. But this one is straightforward and tell me the fundamental explanation. 

I followed this instruction but not `Webpack`. It doesn't work for me. So I use `tsc-watch` instead. 

In GraphQL, there are 3 important things we need to know. 
- GraphQL server: In REST, we use HTTP server, but here, we use GraphQL server. 
- type-defs.ts: Define custom data types, queries, mutations here. 
- resolvers: implement queries, mutations. 

# Wrapping up 
Just few simple things from this tutorial and change a bit to undrestand. Still learning from other articles, then will be back to change and write more.
